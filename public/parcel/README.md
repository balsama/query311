# Bootstrap w/ Parcel

Include [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)'s source Sass and individual JavaScript plugins with [Parcel](https://parceljs.org).

## Edit in browser

_Unfortunately, Parcel does not support StackBlitz, so you'll have to clone this project to use it._

## How to use

```sh
git clone https://github.com/twbs/examples.git
cd examples/parcel/
npm install
npm start
```
